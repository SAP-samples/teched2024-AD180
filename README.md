## Overview
[^Top of page](#)

ABAP Cloud is the development model for building clean core compliant apps, services, and extensions on SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP S/4HANA, and SAP BTP ABAP Environment. ABAP Cloud covers different development scenarios such as transactional, analytical, intgeration, and enterprise search scenarios. The ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) ist at the heart of ABAP Cloud for building transactional SAP Fiori apps, OData-based Web API, local APIs, and business events.

This jump-start session introduces attendees to the Joule's ABAP developer capabilities that support rapid development of both transactional and read-only SAP Fiori elements-based apps with ABAP Cloud. Attendees will also learn how to display data in hierarchical treeview in SAP Fiori apps and how to use ABAP Cloud to define and raise business events that can be consumed locally or remotely via SAP Event Mesh for loosely coupled integration scenarios. 

## Requirements for attending this workshop
[^Top of page](#)

> The prerequisites for following the exercises in this repository are the installation of the latest version of the ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse (ADT)
on your laptop or PC and the access to a suitable ABAP system (i.e. SAP BTP ABAP Environment) connected to the [SAP AI Core](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/sap-ai-core). In addition, the appropriate flavor of the [ABAP Flight Reference Scenario](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-refscen-flight) (package `/DMO/FLIGHT`) must be imported into the system. 

Before completing the exercises in this repository, you need to:

1. [Install the latest Eclipse platform and the latest ABAP Development Tools (ADT) plugin](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-install-adt.html)
2. [Create an user on the SAP BTP ABAP Environment Trial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-trial-onboarding.html)
   > ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: The _SAP BTP ABAP Environment_ trial will be connected to the SAP AI Core from 8 to 11 October for SAP TechEd Virtual 2024.
3. [Create an ABAP Cloud Project](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-create-abap-cloud-project.html)
4. Adapt the Web Browser settings in your ADT installation:   
    i) Choose _Window_ > _Preferences_ in the menu bar.   
    ii) Navigate to _General_ > _Web Browser_.  
    iii) Activate the radio button _Use external web browser_.   
    iv) Select one of the listed external web browsers that are available, e.g. _Default system web browser_.    
        ‚ùóMake sure that _Internet Explorer_ is not selected.

## Exercises
[^Top of page](#)

### üõ†Exercise Block A: Building Transactional, Draft-enabled SAP Fiori Apps with Business Events

> In this exercise block, you will learn how to build a **transactional**, draft-enabled SAP Fiori app from scratch using RAP powered by Joule's ABAP developer capabilities to manage _agency_ data. You will then learn how to define and raise business events for loosely coupled integration scenarios. Finally, you will learn how to implement an event handler for the local consumption of the RAP business events directly on the application server.

### üõ†Exercise Block B: Displaying hierachical data in SAP Fiori UI using read-only treeview

> In this exercise block, you will learn how to build a **read-only** SAP Fiori app using ABAP Cloud assisted by the Joule's ABAP developer capabilities to display _employee_ data. You will then learn how to define and display hierarchical data in a read-only treeview in an SAP Fiori app.
> 
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: This is a standalone exercise block that can be completed independently of the previous exercise block (A). In case you are starting with this exercise block, then please start with [Getting Started](exercises/ex0/README.md).

### üõ† Optional Exercise: Create and deploy a SAP Fiori elements app with SAP Build Code

> To create, deploy, and run the actual SAP Fiori elements-based _Manage Agency_ or _Manage Employee_ app using SAP Build COde (especially the _SAP Business Application Studio_), follow the instructions provided in the tutorial below.    
> The _SAP Fiori elements App Preview_ integrated in ADT is only used to preview of the resulting app as the name indicates. 

<!-- > ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: This exercise can be completed immediately after Exercise Block A and Exercise Block B, which are independent exercises blocks. -->
