## Overview
[^Top of page](#)

ABAP Cloud is the development model for building clean core compliant apps, services, and extensions on SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP S/4HANA, and SAP BTP ABAP Environment. ABAP Cloud covers different development scenarios such as transactional, analytical, intgeration, and enterprise search scenarios. The ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) ist at the heart of ABAP Cloud for building transactional SAP Fiori apps, OData-based Web API, local APIs, and business events.

This session introduces attendees to the Joule's ABAP developer capabilities that support the fast development of transactional asa well as read-only SAP Fiori elements apps with ABAP Cloud. Attendees will learn how to display data in hierarchical treeview and how to define and raise business events with ABAP Cloud that can be consumed locally or remotely via SAP Event Mesh for loosely coupled integration scenarios. 

**SAP Fiori element-based app 01**  
In the first exercise block, you will learn how to build a transactional, draft-enabled SAP Fiori app with ABAP RAP powered by Joule's ABAP Developer capabilities, define and raise business events for loosely coupled scenarios. You will also learn to implement an event handler for the local consumption of the RAP business events.

## Requirements for attending this workshop
[^Top of page](#)

The requirements to follow the exercises in this repository are the installation of the latest version of the ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse (ADT) installation 
on your laptop or PC and the access to a suitable ABAP system with a connection to the GenAI Hub, i.e. SAP BTP ABAP Environment with the connection to the [SAP AI Core](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/sap-ai-core). The appropriate flavor of the [ABAP Flight Reference Scenario](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-refscen-flight) (package `/DMO/FLIGHT`) must be imported into the relevant system. 

Before completing the exercises in this repository, you need to:
1. [Install the latest Eclipse platform and the latest ABAP Development Tools (ADT) plugin](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-install-adt.html)
2. [Create an user on the SAP BTP ABAP Environment Trial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-trial-onboarding.html) *
   > ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: For the the SAP TechEd Virtual 2024, the _SAP BTP ABAP Environment_ trial will be connected to the SAP AI Core from the 8th to the 11th October.
3. [Create an ABAP Cloud Project](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-create-abap-cloud-project.html)
4. Adapt the Web Browser settings in your ADT installation:   
    i) Choose _Window_ > _Preferences_ in the menu bar.   
    ii) Navigate to _General_ > _Web Browser_.  
    iii) Activate the radio button _Use external web browser_.   
    iv) Select one of the listed external web browsers that are available, e.g. _Default system web browser_.    
        ‚ùóMake sure that _Internet Explorer_ is not selected.
