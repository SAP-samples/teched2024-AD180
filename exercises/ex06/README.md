# ‚ö†Ô∏è THIS PAGE WILL BE DELETED SOON ‚ö†Ô∏è- Exercise 6: Define the Hierarchy Interpretation

üößüößüößüöß

## Introduction

> In the previous exercise, you've enhanced the interface view to define and expose a self-association to it. (see [Exercise 5](../ex05/README.md)). 
> 
> In this exercise, you will define how the hierarchical data is interpreted with a parent-child hierarchy in a CDS hierarchy view.
> 

### Exercise Steps:
- [Exercise 6.1 - Define the Hierarchy Interpretation](#step-61-define-the-hierarchy-interpretation)
- [Summary & Next Exercise](#summary--next-exercise)  


## Exercise 6.1: Define the Hierarchy Interpretation 
[^Top of page](#)
   
  > In this view, you need to define and expose a self-association to the parent node of that same CDS view **`ZI_EmployeeHN_###`**. 
  > 
  > üößüößüöß or **`ZR_EmployeeHN_###`**???

   2. Delete the default source code will be displyed in editor and replace it with the source code provided below. 
   
      Do not forget to replace all occurences of the placeholder **`###`** with your chosen suffix.
  
      ```ABAP
         @AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
         @EndUserText.label: 'Hierarchy: Read Only: Employee Hierarchy'

         define hierarchy ZI_EmployeeHN_###
           as parent child hierarchy(
             source ZI_Employee_###
             child to parent association _Manager
             start where
               Manager is initial
             siblings order by
               LastName ascending
           )
         {
           key EmployeeUuid,
               ManagerUuid,
               Employee,
               Manager
         }
      ```

           Define how the hierarchical data is interpreted with a parent-child hierarchy in the artifact `ZR_EmployeeHN_###`:         
           ```ABAP
              define hierarchy ZR_EmployeeHN_### as parent child hierarchy
           ```     

            Define how the hierarchical data is interpreted with a parent-child hierarchy in the artifact `ZR_EmployeeHN_###`:
            ```ABAP
             define hierarchy ZR_EmployeeHN_### as parent child hierarchy
            ```     

            Refer to the hierarchical data /DMO/I_Employee_HR as a source:
            ```ABAP
                source ZR_Employee_### child to parent association _Manager
            ```               

            The hierarchy typically starts where there is no manager above, which is the CEO. Therefore, the root node of the hierarchy is where the manager ID is zero (initial).
            ```ABAP
              start where Manager is initial
            ```                         
            In this example, siblings are employees who report to the same manager. You can sort siblings by their last name, for example:
            ```ABAP
            siblings order by LastName ascending
            ```

## Summary & Next Exercise
[^Top of page](#)

Now that you've... 
- defined the hierarchy interpretation, i.e. how the hierarchical data is interpreted with a parent-child hierarchy in a CDS hierarchy view 

you can continue with the next exercise - **[Exercise 7: Adjust the Generated Consumption View & Display the Treeview](../ex07/README.md)**.
