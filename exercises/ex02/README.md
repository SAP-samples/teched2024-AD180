# Exercise 2: Enhance the RAP BO Behavior with a Business Event and Consume it locally

## Introduction
In the previous exercise, you've generated a UI service and the underlying RAP BO with the AI-based RAP BO generator (_Beta_) (see [Exercise 1](../ex01/README.md)).   

In this exercise, your RAP BO acts as an **event provider**. You will enhance the behavior definition of the _Agency_ BO entity ![bdef](../images/adt_bdef.png)**`ZR_Agency###`** with the business event  **`entity_created`**, which will be raised to send a message each time a new instance of the _Agency_ BO node is created to notify potential consumers.  

For the local event consumption, you will implement an event handler class that acts as an **event consumer**, listening to and processing events raised by your _Agency_ RAP BO in the same system.

### About Business Events in RAP

<details>
  <summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è Click to expand the details!</summary>
  
> Developers can now define and raise business events in a RAP BO or in a RAP BO behavior extension. 
> 
> RAP supports event-driven architecture natively on SAP BTP ABAP environment and SAP S/4HANA in the cloud and on-prem as of release 2022. Event-driven architecture enables asynchronous communication between an event provider and an event consumer in use cases where no direct response from the event consumer is required. 
> 
> Business events provide the opportunity of light-weight, decoupled process integration based on standardized and stable APIs and they are now a native part of the SAP - ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model. With the RAP Business Event Bindings Editor, you can create RAP Event Bindings which are needed to provide a mapping between the definition of RAP Events via behavior definition (BDEF) and the external representation of Business Events.
> 
> A RAP BO can act as event consumer or event provider.
>  
> RAP Business events can be consumed in other systems (_remote consumption_), or in the same system as they are raised (_local consumption_).

## Exercise 2.1: Define the Business Event Parameter
[^Top of page](#)

> Define an abstract entity that will later be used as parameter for defining the business event **`entity_created`**. The abstract entity define the interface for the data transfer to the event consumers.

 <details>
  <summary>üîµ Click to expand!</summary>

  1. Create a new CDS abstract entity![ddls](../images/adt_ddls.png).
  
     For that, go to the **Project Explorer**, navigate to the folder **Core Data Services** > **Data Definition** in your package, right-click on it, choose **New Data Definition** from the context menu, and maintain the required information provided below. 
       
      - Name: **`ZA_Agency_###`** (where `###` is your suffix)
      - Description: _**`Agency abtract entity`**_     
    
     Click **Next >**, and then finish.  
  
     <img src="images/event1.png" alt="CDS Abstract Entity" width="80%">   
  
  3. Replace the default data definition with the source code provided below. Replace the placeholder **`###`** is your suffix.
        
        ```ABAP CDS
        @EndUserText.label: 'Agency abtract entity'
        define abstract entity ZA_Agency_###
        {
          agency_id   : abap.numc(6);
          agency_name : abap.char(80);
          created_by  : abp_creation_user;
          created_at  : abp_creation_tstmpl;            
        }  
        ```
  
     <img src="images/event2.png" alt="CDS Abstract Entity" width="60%">   
    
  3. Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) (**Ctrl+S**) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) (**Ctrl+F3**) the new abstract entity.   
   
</details>


## Exercise 2.2: Define the Business Event in the _Agency_ BO
[^Top of page](#)

> Define the business event **`entity_created`** in the behavior definition of the _Agency_ BO.

 <details>
  <summary>üîµ Click to expand!</summary>

 1. Open the behavior definition of your _Agency_ BO ![bdef](../images/adt_bdef.png)**`ZR_Agency###`** in your package.
  
 2. Define the event **`entity_created`** using the keyword **`event`** in the behavior definition of the **_Agency_** BO node as shown on the screenshot below. The newly created abstract entity will be used as **`ZA_Agency_###`**.
  
    Insert the code snippet provided below for the purpose after the **`delete;`** statement. Replace the placeholder **`###`** with your suffix.

    ```ABAP
      //event(s)
      event entity_created parameter ZA_Agency_###;  
    ```  
  
 3. Business events must be raised in the save sequence at runtime, therefore, we have to enable the _additional save_ for our managed BO by specifying the statement **`with additional save`**. We will also add the keywords **`with full data`** to always have access to all the data of the relevant _Agency_ entity instances without having to read them.
  
    For that, insert the code snippet provided below after the `authorization master( global )` statement as shown on the screenshot below.

    ```ABAP
      with additional save with full data
    ```  
  
    <img src="images/event3.png" alt="Agency BO node bdef" width="80%">  
  
 4. Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) (**Ctrl+S**) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) (**Ctrl+F3**) the changes. 
 
    A **warning** now appears about the need for a redefinition of the local saver method **`save_modified`**. You will tackle this in the next step.

  4. Adjust the behavior implementation class (aka behavior pool) of the _Agency_ entity to reflect the enhancements of behavior definition. 
  
     > Hint: The logic for raising business event must be implemented in the method **`save_modified`** of the local saver class.
     
     For that, set the cursor on the statement **`with additional save with full data``** and press **Ctrl+1** to start the ADT Quick Fix.

     Select **`Add required method save_modified in new local saver class`** in the _Quick Assist_ view to update the behavior pool accordingly.
    
     <img src="images/event4.png" alt="Raise event" width="100%">  
     
     The adjusted local saver class of the behavior implementation class ![class](../images/adt_class.png)**`ZBP_R_AGENCY###`** is now opened in **Local Types** tab of the editor.

     > ‚ö†Ô∏è**Note**: Please check the name of your behavior pool in the BO behavior definition, as it may be different. Don't forget that all artifacts of your application are AI-generated.
  
</details>


## Exercise 2.3: Raise the Event in the _Agency_ BO
[^Top of page](#)

> You will now implement the logic for raising the business event **`entity_created`** in the local saver class of the BO behavior implementation class, 
> aka behavior pool, ![class](../images/adt_class.png)**`ZBP_R_AGENCY###`**.
> 
> The event **`entity_created`** will be raised with the information specified in the abstract entity anytime a new _Agency_ instance is created. 

 <details>
  <summary>üîµ Click to expand!</summary>

  1. Raise the event **`entity_created`** whenever a new _Agency_ instance is created in the local saver class **`lsc_zr_agency###`** of the behavior implementation class located on the **Local Types** tab (![class](../images/adt_local_types.png)).
  
     For that, replace the empty implementation of the method **`save_modified`** with the source code provided below and replace all occurences of the placeholder **`###`** with your suffix (**Ctrl+F**).
  
     ```ABAP
     METHOD save_modified.
       "send notification for new agency instances
       IF create IS NOT INITIAL.
         "raise event
         RAISE ENTITY EVENT zr_agency###~entity_created
          FROM VALUE #(
            FOR agency IN create-agency
              "transferred information
              ( %key        = agency-%key
                agency_id   = agency-agencyId
                agency_name = agency-agencyName
                created_by  = agency-LocalCreatedBy
                created_at  = agency-LocalCreatedAt
              )
            ).
       ENDIF.
     ENDMETHOD.  
     ```
  
     <img src="images/event5.png" alt="Raise event" width="70%">    
  
  4. Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) (**Ctrl+S**) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) (**Ctrl+F3**) the changes. 
   
  You can now close the behavior implementation class and continue with the next step where you will create a simple handler class to consume raised events.
     
</details>


## Exercise 2.4: Create a Local Event Handler
[^Top of page](#)

> For the local consumption of the raised events directly on the same system, you will now create a simple event handler class which will log the received event data in a database table.

 <details>
  <summary>üîµ Click to expand!</summary>

  1. First, create a database table ![save table](../images/adt_tabl.png)**`ZAGENCY###_E`** with a UUID-based primary key to store the received event information. 
     
     For that, go to your package **`ZRAP120_AGENCY_###`**, navigate to the folder **Dictionary** > **Database Tables**, right-click on it, and select the entry **New Database Table** from the context menu to launch the creation wizard.
       
     Maintain the required information provided below and click **Next >**.  
  
      - Name: **`ZAGENCY###_E`**, where `###` is your suffix
      - Description: **`Event data for new agencies`**
  
     Select a transport request and click **Finish** to create the database table.
  
     <img src="images/event6.png" alt="Event Handler Class" width="60%"> 

  3. Replace the default table definition with the source code provided below and replace all occurences of the placeholder **`###`** with your suffix. 
  
      <pre lang="ABAP">
      @EndUserText.label : 'Event handler - New agency data'
      @AbapCatalog.enhancement.category : #EXTENSIBLE_ANY
      @AbapCatalog.tableCategory : #TRANSPARENT
      @AbapCatalog.deliveryClass : #A
      @AbapCatalog.dataMaintenance : #RESTRICTED
      define table zagency###_e {

        key mandt   : mandt not null;
        key uuid    : sysuuid_x16 not null;
        agency_id   : abap.numc(6);
        agency_name : abap.char(80);
        created_by  : abp_creation_user;
        created_at  : abp_creation_tstmpl;
      }
      </pre>  
  
      <img src="images/event7.png" alt="Event Handler Class" width="50%"> 

  3. Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) (**Ctrl+S**) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) (**Ctrl+F3**) the changes.
  
  4. Now go ahead, create and implement the event handler class ![class](../images/adt_class.png)**`ZEH_NEW_AGENCY_###`** for the local consumption of the event **`entity_created`** raised by the _Agency_ BO entity.
     
     For that, go to the **Project Explorer**, navigate to the folder **Source Code Library** > **Classes** in your package, right-click on it, and select the entry **New ABAP Classes** from the context menu to launch the creation wizard.
   
     Maintain the required information provided below and press **Finish**.
  
       - Name: **`ZEH_NEW_AGENCY_###`**, where `###` is your suffix
       - Description: **`Event handler for new Agency instances`**  
     
     Select a transport request, and click **Finish** to create the ABAP class.
  
     <img src="images/event8.png" alt="local event handler class" width="50%"> 
  
  5. Specify the class as event handler class pool for your RAP BO by adding the statement **`FOR EVENTS OF <entity_name>`** of the class definition section on the **Global Class** tab, directly after the keyword **`FINAL`** as shown on the screenshot. Replace the placeholder **`###`** with your suffix.
  
     <pre lang="ABAP">
          FOR EVENTS OF ZR_AGENCY###
     </pre>
   
     <img src="images/event9.png" alt="local event handler class" width="50%">  
  
     You can now go ahead with the event handler implementation.
 
  6. Now go to the **Local Types** tab (![class](../images/adt_local_types.png)) to define and implement the local event handler class **`lhe_agency`** for the _Agency_ BO entity. 
  
     For that, simply replace the skeleton code with the source code provided in the document below. You can access the ABAP Keyword documentation (**F1**) for more details on the classes `cl_abap_behavior_event_handler` and `cl_abap_tx` used in the implementation.
  
     Do not forget to replace all occurences of the placeholder **`###`** with your suffix (**Ctrl+F**).

 1. First, start the Data Preview (F8) of the new database table **`ZAGENCY###_E`** to store the received event information. No data should appear because no new _Agency_ has been created and therefore the event **`entity_created`** has not been raised yet.
  
     <img src="images/event11.png" alt="local event handler class" width="70%">    
  
 2. Now, go to your _Manage Agencies_ app, and, create a new _Agency_ record.

 3. Go back to the ABAP Development Tools and refresh the Data Preview of the database table `ZAGENCY###_E` or start the Data Preview again (**F8**).  
  
    A new entry for the newly created _Agency_ record should now be stored in the database table.

     <img src="images/event13.png" alt="local event handler class" width="70%">
