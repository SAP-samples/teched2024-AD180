# Exercise 4: Generate read-only OData UI Service E2E with GenAI and RAP

## Introduction

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: This exercise is independent from the previous exercise block (A), i.e. [exercises 1-3](../ex01/README.md). 

In this exercise group (B), you will create a read-only OData UI service along with the underlying RAP business object to manage agencies using the GenAI-based ABAP repository object generator (_Beta_) provided in the ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse (ADT). 

In the present exercise, you will create an ABAP package, generate all development artefacts using the GenAI-based ADT wizard and a predefined promt with a natural description of the application, and then create am ABAP class to populate demo agency data in the generated database table. The generation will create the required database table, the CDS data model, the service definition, and the service binding. 

At the end, you will publish and preview your _Employee_ app using the _Fiori Elements App Preview_ function provided in ADT.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Reminder:**   
> Don't forget to replace all occurences of the placeholder **`###`** with your chosen suffix or Group ID in the exercise steps below.   
> You can use the ADT function **Replace All** (**Ctrl+F**) for the purpose.   
> If you haven't been assigned a Group ID, then select a combination of three (3) numbers and/or letters, such as e.g. `000` or `AI1`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Always remember in mind that the names of your development objects may differ from the names used in the exercise instructions, code snippets, and screenshots. 

## Exercise 4.1: Create an ABAP Package
[^Top of page](#)

> Create your exercise package ![package](../images/adt_package.png)**`ZEmployee_Hierarchy_RO_###`**.   
> This ABAP package will contain all the artefacts you will be creating in the different exercises of this hands-on session.

      Maintain the required information provided below and click **Next** to continue. 
 
      Replace the occurrence of the placeholder **`###`** with your chosen or assigned suffix, which should be a combination of three (3) numbers and/or letters, e.g. **`476`** or **`AP3`**.

## Exercise 4.2: Generate a read-only UI Service using GenAI

   1. Right-click on your ![project](../images/adt_project.png)ABAP Cloud project and select **New** > **Generate ABAP Repository Objects** from the context menu.
      
      Select the entry **`OData UI Service Supported by AI (Beta)`** in the wizard and click **Next >**.
      
      Maintain your package name ![package](../images/adt_package.png)**`ZRAP120_Employee_###`** and click **Next >**.                  
 
      <table>

          <td><img src="images/ro04.png" alt="generate UI service" width="100%"></td>
      </tr>
      </table>

   3. Clear the default prompt, insert the one provided below for this exercise, and click **Next >**. 
 
      Replace the occurence of the placeholder `###` with your chosen suffix.
      
 
      ```PROMPT
        Generate a read-only application for displaying employees. 
        The employee entity requires the fields employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary, manager_id, and manager_uuid. 
        Use a numerical data type with length 6 for the fields employee_id and manager_id.
        Use the uuid data type for the field manager_uuid.
        Use built-in character string data type char with length 40 for the fields first_name and last_name. 
        Salary is a currency field with length 21. 
        Create the object names with the suffix '###'.
      ```

      <img src="images/ro05.png" alt="generate UI service" width="50%">
 
       The wizard now shows the list of all artifacts that will be generated and the ability to preview some of them - e.g. database tables.

          First, create the database table ![table](../images/adt_tabl.png)**`ZEMPLOYEE###`** and replace the default code with thetable definition provided below. 
        
         Then right-click on it and select the entry **`Generate ABAP Repository Objects...`** from the context menu, and select **`OData UI Service`** in the dialog to start the classic generation.

## Exercise 4.3: Adjust the Generated UI Service 
[^Top of page](#)

> Typically, you will need to adjust the generated artifacts to fit your use case - e.g. the data type of some of the database fields and the application layout in the browser.
> 
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è PS: The generated artefact and field names may differ from the ones use in the description below.
 
### Exercise 4.3.1: Adjust the Generated Database Table 
 
> In this exercise, you will eventually have to adjust the data type of the fields containing the **employee ID**, the **manager ID**, and the **salary** in the database tables. The data type of the fields **`employee_id`** and **`manager_id`** should be a numical text with length 8, i.e. **`abap.numc(8)`**.  The field **`salary`** should be a currency field with length 21, i.e. **`abap.curr(21,2)`**.

  <summary>üîµ Click to expand!</summary>

   1. Go to your package in the **Project Explorer**, open the database table ![table](../images/adt_tabl.png)**`ZEMPLOYEE###`** for storing the active agency data, and replace the data type of the fields **`employee_id`** and **`manager_id`** with **`abap.numc(8)`** if necessary.      
 
      ```ABAP
       abap.numc(8) 
      ```       
  
      Also replace the data type of the field **`salary`** with **`abap.curr(21,2)`** if necessary.
  
      ```ABAP
       abap.curr(21,2)
      ```         

      <img src="images/ro10.png" alt="Adjust generated UI service" width="50%">

   2. Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) the changes.  
  
      You can now create _employee_ records in the Fiori app if you want. You will generate some demo data in the next step.

### Exercise 4.3.2: Adjust the UI Semantics  
 
> In this exercise, you will will adjust the application layout by adjusting the UI semantic in the metadata extension. 
> 
 <details>
  <summary>üîµ Click to expand!</summary>

   1. Go to your package in the **Project Explorer**, open the generated CDS metadata extension ![ddlx](../images/adt_ddlx.png)**`ZC_EMPLOYEE###`**.


   2. Hide the element **`Uuid`** by removing all `@UI` annotations specified directly above it, ‚õî**except** for the **`@UI.facet`** annotation block which must remain in the metadata extension, and inserting the line provided below.   
    
      ```CDS
       @UI.hidden: true 
      ```            
   
      <img src="images/ro11.png" alt="Adjust generated UI service" width="50%">

   2. Also hide the element **`ManagerUuid`** by removing all `@UI` annotations specified directly above it and replacing it with the line provided below.     
  
      ```CDS
       @UI.hidden: true 
      ```            

      <img src="images/ro11b.png" alt="Adjust generated UI service" width="50%">
  
   3. You can also, for example, adjust the specified labels:
      - EmployeeId --> Employee ID
      - FirstName --> First Name
      - LastName --> Last Name
      - ManagerId --> Manager ID

  <!---
  Employee ID
  
      | **RAP Layer**                          | **New Label**                 | 
      |----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
      |   **EmployeeId**                                    | **Employee ID**                  | 
      |    **FirstName**                                    |  First Name                               | 
      |                                        | **Behavior**                    |
      |                                        |                                 | 

-->
        
   4 Save ![save icon](../images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](../images/adt_activate.png) the changes.

         > 1) In the `INSERT` block, the relevant data is read from the database table `/dmo/employee_hr`, which contains _employee_ data and belongs to the _Flight Reference Scenario_. The built-in function `uuid(  )` is used to generate a uuid for the key field `employee_uuid` of the generated table `zemployee_hr###`, because the source database table (`/dmo/employee_hr`) has a semantic primary key (`employee`). A dummy value is set for the field `manager_uuid` at this stage.
         >        
         > 2) In the 2nd block, the correct manager UUID, i.e. field `manager_uuid`, is assigned using the semantic primary key `employee_id` and the field `manager_id`. 
         >        
         > 3) The `COMMIT WORK` statement triggers an explicit database commit to persist the data and close all opened database cursors .
